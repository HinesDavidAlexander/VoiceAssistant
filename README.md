# My Home Assistant - 1 Day Project

## Overview

This project is a one-day experiment aimed at creating a simple version of a home assistant. The goal is to implement basic functionalities that can serve as a foundation for a more complex home automation system. Due to the limited timeframe, the focus is on simplicity, feasibility, and demonstration of core concepts rather than building a fully-featured application.

## Features

- **Voice Command Recognition**: Accept basic voice commands to perform tasks like turning on/off lights, playing music, or checking the weather.
- **Device Integration**: Basic integration with simulated home devices (e.g., lights, thermostat).
- **Weather Updates**: Provide current weather information upon request.

## Limitations

Given the time constraint of a single day, the following limitations apply:

- Limited device compatibility: Only a predefined set of virtual devices will be controllable.
- Simplified voice recognition: May not accurately interpret all commands due to the use of basic voice recognition techniques.
- Basic functionality: Features will be rudimentary, focusing on demonstrating the concept rather than providing a polished user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x (for its extensive support for quick prototyping and available libraries for device control and voice recognition).
- **Libraries**: 


## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone [PLACEHOLDER]https://github.com/your-username/my-home-assistant.git`
2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary Python libraries.
3. **API Keys**: Obtain necessary API keys (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) and set them in the configuration file (`config.py`).
4. **Run the Assistant**: Execute `python assistant.py` to start the home assistant. Ensure your microphone is set up correctly for voice commands.

## Usage

- **Voice Commands**: Say "Turn on the lights", "What's the weather?", or "Play music" after the beep sound to interact with the assistant.
- **GUI Interface**: Access the simple dashboard by running `main.py`

## Contributing

This is a one-day project and not intended for further development. However, suggestions and feedback are welcome to inspire future projects or improvements.
